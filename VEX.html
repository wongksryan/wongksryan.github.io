            Built primarily over the summer after finishing the International Baccalaureate, this prototype focused heavily on weight minimization and efficient motor allocation. The unusual roller layout enabled ball output from five separate ports while using only 22W of motor power for scoring, allowing 66W to be dedicated to the drivetrain for maximum speed and torque performance. This was my final major build contribution before transitioning fully from captain to coach.

        Led documentation and team organization across a roughly 280 page engineering notebook covering topics such as ANSYS simulations, path optimization using Bezier splines, pressure leakage calculations for live match strategy, and more. I designed the overall structure, maintained budget tracking and Gantt charts, and handled much of the administrative workload. The full notebook is not shared publicly to avoid leaking team methods and competitive strategies.

          <p>
            Learning from the previous season, we upgraded to a six motor drivetrain instead of four, increased gearbox RPM from 200 to 600, and reduced wheel size. This more than doubled our speed while increasing torque by roughly 1.7 times. We also focused heavily on improving structural efficiency to save weight. The robot was ultimately left unfinished due to team restructuring and the need to support two new teams.

            After completing team restructuring, we pivoted strategy to align more closely with emerging game metas. This robot was one of the first designs our team was genuinely satisfied with in terms of performance. We also ran static FEA in Fusion 360 for the first time due to extensive use of polycarbonate in the structure. This robot won the Design Award at Hong Kong Finals and qualified us for VEX Worlds.

            A full redesign addressing major weaknesses in the previous robot. We tested extensively, including pneumatic leakage checks and friction optimization on intake rollers. More FEA was conducted, and many aluminium components were replaced with laser cut Delrin or polycarbonate to reduce weight. The final robot weighed roughly 62 percent of our previous Worlds robot while achieving significantly higher reliability.

            Our first robot and our first experience with CAD. The design was intentionally built as flat as possible to crawl under the goal and descore. It featured two wide side panels and an extremely powerful central catapult, powerful enough to crack the ratchet gear twice. While the overall robot was not particularly competitive, it functioned and served as a critical learning platform for the team.

            This robot won us the Excellence Award at Hong Kong Finals and qualified us for VEX Worlds. Its heavy and robust construction allowed us to block shots effectively, shove defenders aside, and even tip opposing robots that attempted to climb the center pole. The upgraded catapult could launch two balls per second, which required two teammates to train specifically on synchronized loading.

            A defense focused robot featuring a foldout shield that nearly tripled the robot’s height once deployed. The image shown was before we refined the design into a triple fold mechanism. Additional folding flaps were added to improve maneuverability. Unfortunately, axle sag over time(we did not know about aluminium creep properties) combined with rough airline handling caused severe drivetrain issues. The robot required three consecutive nights of repairs until 4am just to remain functional during Worlds(which is why I look a bit gaunt in the Worlds photos).
